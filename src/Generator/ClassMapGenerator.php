/**
 * Emits the tree's own index: what it generated, and where each class lives.
 *
 * The conformance gate has to turn a spec name like `Post` into `App\Entity\Post\Post`
 * and load the file holding it. It used to do that by calling `Names` — the generator's
 * own naming code — which meant the gate could only run somewhere the PHP generator was
 * on the classpath. That is exactly the coupling a builder is supposed to not have: a
 * TypeScript builder could never satisfy it.
 *
 * Writing the answer into the tree instead makes the generated output the source of
 * truth, which is stronger than sharing a class rather than weaker. A map that
 * disagreed with the files beside it would be a map the drift gate rewrites, because it
 * is generated and signed like everything else here.
 *
 * `classes` is complete, so a consumer can autoload the tree without knowing that the
 * namespace below the root mirrors the directory. Nothing outside has to restate that
 * convention, which is the second place it used to be written down.
